 * 001 - Full Solid Color.

 * WHAT WE'RE BUILDING:
 * A very simple effect that just lights up the entire strip in a single color
 *
 * The most basic effect you could make is the full solid color effect, where the entire strip is lit up in a single
 * color. To do this, we'll learn:
 * - how to create an Led Pipeline
 * - how to add an effect to a pipeline
 * - how to run a pipeline to make effects show up on your LEDs.

     * many times, you might want to make effects that are made up of multiple other effects internally. To make those kinds
     * of effects, you can use actual pipelines, such as SeriesLedPipeline and ParallelLedPipeline. We'll dive into these
     * in future tutorials, such as 002, which will walk through a SeriesLedPipeline.
     *
     * For now, we just want to use a single effect that sets up the entire strip to run in a single color, so we only need
     * the one effect/stage. In LedPipelines, the effect that lights up the entire strip in a single color is called
     * SolidEffect. We can set the pipeline to be the one stage that we want, by also passing in the color that we want
     * to set it to.

 * As we can see, setting up single effects is super easy! But that's not where LedPipelines shines. LedPipelines is really
